Notes

In the confirmation dialog there are two buttons. The confirm button is in the primary position and the cancel button is in the secondary position.
If Confirmation Header and Confirmation Message are null, the SAIL interface refreshes and the Save Value To state change occurs once the user clicks the link. If either is not null, the confirmation dialog box displays. The SAIL interface only refreshes and the Save Value To state change only occurs if the user clicks the confirm button.
The cancel button is always "SECONDARY" style.
