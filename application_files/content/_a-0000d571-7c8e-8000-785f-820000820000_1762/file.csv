63,Facets - Time (entity only) - internal java api for returning filtered listview and list of facets,7,25,1,A few reasons: 1. Implementing eror handling for entity as source of record took longer than estimated. 2. The spec for time facets was done only 2 days before the sprint end/ and it included a detail that was not accounted for in the API built during the previous sprint. 3. The design-time record definition stores a literal configration with some fields as expressions.
